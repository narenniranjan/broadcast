# broadcast
A proper relay bot.

# Requirements
pydle, python-mumble (found at rfw/python-mumble - note it has to be version 0.1.3 or it will not work properly), and eventually discord.py (though it is currently unused). As such you also need python3.5, as python-mumble requires it. 

# Setup
Modify the provided example.json to fit your needs. Run the bot with

`python3 broadcast.py --config config.json`
